# Miry’s World Swipe (HTML5 Mobile Game)

A fun, silly swipe-lane game you can run in any modern mobile browser.

## How to play
- Swipe **left/right** to change lanes
- Swipe **up** to BOOST (brief invulnerability)
- Swipe **down** to SNACK (spend a 🍎 token to heal if you’re below 3 lives)

Collect souvenirs and snacks. Avoid obstacles.

## Run locally
Just open `index.html` in a browser.
If you want a local server (recommended on some phones):
- Python: `python -m http.server 8000`
Then visit `http://<your-ip>:8000`

Enjoy!
